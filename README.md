There are two versions of the app. app_version1 was the inital design that I had some trouble with. I wanted to create a response for both 'y' and 'n' in version 1 I had the responses seperated but I ran into issues with that and so in version2 I ended up intergrating responses for both 'y' and 'n'. I admittedly did not get to building this out as much as I would have like to but it was a lot of fun nonetheless.
